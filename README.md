Deep learning project using CNN

What are CNN ?

•Convolutional Neural Networks, like neural networks, are made up of neurons with learnable weights and biases. 
Eachneuron receives several inputs, takes a weighted sum over them, passit through an activation function and responds with an output.

•The whole network has a loss functionand all the tips and tricks that we developed for neural networks still apply on Convolutional Neural Networks.

•Neural networks, as its name suggests, is a machine learning techniquewhich is modeled after the brain structure. It comprises of a network of learning units called neurons.

•These neurons learn how to convert input signals (e.g. picture of a cat) into corresponding output signals (e.g. the label “cat”), forming the basis of automated recognition.

How CNN works ?

There are four layered concepts we should understand in Convolutional Neural Networks:

1.Convolution

2.ReLu

3.Pooling 

4.Full Connectedness (Fully Connected Layer).


Problem statement : The objective is to identify (predict) different fashion products from the given images using Convolutional neural network.

Understanding the Dataset : Fashion MNIST Training dataset consists of 60,000 images and each image has 784 features (i.e. 28×28 pixels). Each pixel is a value from 0 to 255, describing the pixel intensity. 0 for white and 255 for black.
